Installation
============
If you don't have a working BATSRUS repository, check it out and install it:

cvs checkout BATSRUS
cd BATSRUS
./Config.pl -install [options]

Then checkout the CRASHTEST directory inside the BATSRUS directory:

cvs checkout CRASHTEST

Running tests
=============

Go into the CRASHTEST repository to run tests, e.g.

cd CRASHTEST
make help
make test MPIRUN="mpirun -np 8"

You can do individual tests too

cd RadHydro/IdealGas/GrayDiffusion/
make help
make test_lowrie1_amr MPIRUN="mpirun -np 4"

You may need to do this in an interactive queue of a cluster, 
because the largest resolution tests may not fit into the memory of a desktop.

The results will be saved into the output/ directory:

*.ref                files with reference solution
*.diff               files showing difference relative to the reference solution
*_results/           directory containing the raw output from the test runs
*_results/error.dat  file containing the numerical errors
*_results/*.eps      file(s) showing figures 

Clean up
========
Type

make clean

in the appropriate directory(ies)
