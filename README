Installation
============
If you don't have a working BATSRUS repository, check it out and install it:

cvs checkout BATSRUS
cd BATSRUS
./Config.pl -install [options]

Then checkout the CRASHTEST directory inside the BATSRUS directory:

cvs checkout CRASHTEST

Running tests
=============

Go into the CRASHTEST repository to run tests, e.g.

cd RadHydro/IdealGas/GrayDiffusion/
make help
make test_lowrie1_amr MPIRUN="mpirun -np 4"

You may need to do this in an interactive queue of a cluster, 
because the largest resolution tests may not fit into the memory of a desktop.

The results will be saved into the output/ directory:
  _results/ directory containing the raw output from the test runs
  .err      file containing the numerical errors
  .diff     file showing the difference relative to the reference solution in .ref
  .eps      file(s) showing figures 

For example:

output/test_lowrie1_amr_results/
output/test_lowrie1_amr.err
output/test_lowrie1_amr.diff
output/test_lowrie1_amr.eps

Clean up
========
Type

make clean

in the appropriate directory(ies)
