These three tests by Lowrie are used to verify the gray diffusion solver in
the CRASH code. The first test contains a shock that has been smoothed out
by the radiation. In the second test there is a discontinuity. The 1st and 2nd
tests use constant opacities. In the third test there is a jump,
and the opacity varies with temperature. This last test is the most challenging
as it contains a spike in the gas temperature right behind the shock.

The tests are done on a 2D non-uniform grid. The initial condition is rotated
by atan$(1/2)$ and the solution is advected orthogonal to the shock front
(a constant velocity was added to the steady state solution). The
semi-analytic solution (provided by Lowrie) is advected together with the flow.
The errors are calculated relative to the semi-analytic solution with
various grid resolutions.

We expect second order convergence rate for the first test, and first order
convergence for the second and third tests.
