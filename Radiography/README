Test the radiography post processing algorithm of CRASH. There are the
folowing tests (so far):

test_sphere_3d
test_sphere_amr
test_tube_3d

The three tests are described below.

============================================================================
test_sphere_3d 
==============
integrates a sphere of radius R with density varying as 
rho = R^2-r^2, where r is the radial distance from the center of the sphere. 
For r>R, the density is 0.

One can easily integrate analytically the density along a line
that goes across this sphere at a distance D from the center.
The line cuts the sphere at S = sqrt(R^2 - D^2) distance from the middle
of the inside line segment:

I = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho(s) ds 
  = \int_{-S}^{+S} (R^2 - D^2 - s^2) ds
  = [s*S^2 - s^3/3]_{-S}^{+S}
  = 4/3*S^3 = 4/3*(R^2 - D^2)^(3/2)

If the viewing point is at distance L from the center then the line
belonging to pixel at x,y coordinates will be at a distance

D = d*L/sqrt(L^2 + d^2)

from the center of the sphere, where d = sqrt(x^2+y^2). So the final 
formula for the integral is

I(x,y) = max[ 0, 4/3*(R^2 - L^2/(1 + L^2/(x^2 + y^2)))^(3/2) ]

In the test R = 10 and the viewing point is at X = 60, Y = 80 and Z = 100, 
so L^2 = 20,000.

============================================================================
test_sphere_amr 
===============
does the same as test_sphere_3d, but the grid resolution is
increased by a factor of 2 in the +X, +Y, +Z octant.

============================================================================
test_tube_3d 
============
creates LOS images of a shocktube including the cylindrical
plastic tube. The Be/Xe interface is at X=5, the Be density is 10, the Xe
density is 20 inside the plastic tube. The plastic tube starts at X=-5,
its inner radius is 10, the outer radius is 15. The plastic density is 30,
the Xe density outside the tube is 10.

The total, Xe, Be, and plastic densities (rho, rhoxe, rhobe and rhopl)
are shown in the X=0, Y=0 and Z=0 cuts and are also integrated
taken from the X,Y,Z = (100,0,0), (0,100,0) and (0,0,100) points.
The plots show the difference rho-rhoxe-rhobe-rhopl that should be
zero down to roundoff error. The "cube10" plot variable is shown in the
LOS images so that the orientation of the plot can be better understood. 
The center of the cube is at X=Y=Z=10, it's size is 20 by 20 by 20.
The cube should always be above the center of the plot, since we want the
"vertical" coordinate of the LOS image to be aligned with the +Z or +Y axes.

Since densities of the Xe, Be and Plastic are differently calculated with 
the levelset and the mixed cell methods, both of them are tested and compared
in the level_mixed_diff plot. The difference should be zero to round-off error.
