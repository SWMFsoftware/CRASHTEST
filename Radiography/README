Test the radiography post processing algorithm of CRASH. There are 5 tests:

test_sphere_3d
test_sphere_amr
test_sphere_rz
test_tube_3d
test_tube_rz

The tests are described below.

============================================================================
test_sphere_3d 
==============
integrates a sphere of radius R with density varying as 
rho = R^2-r^2, where r is the radial distance from the center of the sphere. 
For r>R, the density is 0.

One can easily integrate analytically the density along a line
that goes across this sphere at a distance D from the center.
The line cuts the sphere at S = sqrt(R^2 - D^2) distance from the middle
of the inside line segment:

I = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho(s) ds 
  = \int_{-S}^{+S} (R^2 - D^2 - s^2) ds
  = [s*S^2 - s^3/3]_{-S}^{+S}
  = 4/3*S^3 = 4/3*(R^2 - D^2)^(3/2)

If the viewing point is at distance L from the center then the line
belonging to pixel at x,y coordinates will be at a distance

D = d*L/sqrt(L^2 + d^2)

from the center of the sphere, where d = sqrt(x^2+y^2). So the final 
formula for the integral is

I(x,y) = max[ 0, 4/3*(R^2 - L^2/(1 + L^2/(x^2 + y^2)))^(3/2) ]

In the test R = 10 and the viewing point is at X = 60, Y = 80 and Z = 100, 
so L^2 = 20,000.

Figures:
--------
sphere.pdf 
----------
shows the LOS image of the sphere10 function (top row) and its difference 
relative to the analytic solution (middle row). The bottom row shows the
difference between an interpolated usersphere10 function and the analytic
solution. The grid resolutions varies from 20 (left column), to 40 
(middle column) and 80 (right column). 

error.pdf
---------
shows the relative errors for the interpolated usersphere10 function 
(top line) and the pointwise exact sphere10 function (bottom line)
as a function of grid resolution. Note that the integration step along
the line of sight is proportional to the grid resolution.

============================================================================
test_sphere_amr 
===============
does the same as test_sphere_3d, but the grid resolution is
increased by a factor of 2 in the +X, +Y, +Z octant.

============================================================================
test_sphere_rz
==============
does the same as test_sphere_3d, but in RZ geometry. The sphere is actually
a circle rotated around the X axis. 

============================================================================
test_tube_3d 
============
creates LOS images of a shocktube including the cylindrical
plastic tube. The Be/Xe interface is at X=5, the Be density is 10, the Xe
density is 20 inside the plastic tube. The plastic tube starts at X=-5,
its inner radius is 10, the outer radius is 15. The plastic density is 30,
the Xe density outside the tube is 10.

Figures
-------
tube_cuts.pdf
-------------
shows the X=0 (left column), Y=0 (middle column) and Z=0 (right column)
cuts of the shocktube. The rows show the total, Xe, Be, and plastic densities 
(rho, rhoxe, rhobe and rhopl) and the difference rho-rhoxe-rhobe-rhopl that 
should be zero down to roundoff error. 

tube_los.pdf
------------
shows LOS images taken from the X,Y,Z = (100,0,0), (0,100,0) and (0,0,100) 
points in the left, middle and right colums, respectively.

The top row shows the "cube10" plot variable so that the orientation of the 
LOS plots can be better understood. The center of the 20 by 20 by 20 cube 
is at X=Y=Z=+10. The cube should always be above the center of the plot, 
since we want the "vertical" coordinate of the LOS image to be aligned 
with the +Z or +Y axes. For the LOS image taken from the +Y direction the
cube is to the left, because the +X axis points to the left when viewed
from this direction. This means that this LOS image is flipped relative to
the Y=0 cut.

The rows below show the LOS integrals of the total, Xe, Be, and plastic 
densities: rho, rhoxe, rhobe and rhopl, respectively.
The bottom row shows the difference rho-rhoxe-rhobe-rhopl that should be
zero down to roundoff error. 

Note that the LOS image is 60 by 60, which is larger than the computational
domain that is 40 by 40 by 40, so there are 0 values at the outer edges of
the LOS images.

level_mixed_diff.pdf
--------------------
shows the difference between the LOS integrated densities obtained with
the levelset and mixed cell methods. The difference should be zero to 
round-off error in all densities.

============================================================================
test_tube_rz
============
does the same as test_tube_3d, but in RZ geometry. The 2D initial condition
is rotated around the X axis. 

Figures
-------
tube_rz_cuts.pdf
----------------
Note that the tube is 2D, so the first two cuts are "flat", because there are 
only 2 grid points in the "phi" direction.

tube_rz_los.pdf
---------------
This figure should be compared with the tube_los.pdf figure of the tube_3d test.
The computational domain is a cylinder here, while it is a brick in the tube_3d test.
Consequently the integrals of Xe and Be (that extend to the edges of the domain) 
look different. The cylindrical plastic tube, on the other hand, looks similar.
