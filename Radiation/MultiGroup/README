There are 3 tests.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Infinite medium with two independent gray groups

This test checks the material-radiation relaxation rate.
There are two energy groups (to excersize the multi-group code). 
Initially the material temperature is positive while the radiation
group temperatures are zero. The final temperature is 1 keV. The 
initial material temperature is determined from energy conservation.

The temporal evolution is an exponential relaxation towards the
equilibrium temperature. We expect first order accuracy in time
using the semi-implicit scheme based on spectral temperatures.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Infinite medium with several radiation energy groups

This test checks the material-radiation relaxation rate and
the proper interaction of the radiation energy groups with
the material. The equilibrium state has to be a Planckian 
energy distribution among the groups. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Double light front test

There are two groups. The initial radiation energy is zero. 
The radiation energy for group 1 enters from the left boundary, 
for group 2 it enters from the right boundary. 
Both fronts propagate with the speed of light. This is ensured
by the flux-limiter in the flux-limited gray diffusion algorithm.
The relaxation term between radiation and material is switched off,
so that the two radiation groups evolve independently.

The expected convergence rate is less than 1 (but at least 0.5) 
due to the numerical diffusion of the discontinuities.
