The Su-Olson test is a one-dimensional, non-equilibrium Marshak
wave test and is used to verify the correctness and accuracy of the
time-dependent gray radiation diffusion model. This test is a
linearized radiation transport problem in slab geometry. The
linearization is achieved by the choice of specific heat of material
proportional to the material temperature cubed. Initially both the
material and radiation temperature are zero. On the left boundary
the incoming radiation source is specified as a black body source
radiating with a radiation temperature of 1keV. The radiation
diffuses into the cold half space on the right. The material
temperature also rises due to the energy exchange between radiation
and matter.

The convergence study is performed with two different semi-implicit
schemes:

- radiation: solves for radiation energy density and it sets the the
             internal energy in a point implicit manner.
- radcond:   solves implicitly the gray diffusion with the radiation
             and internal energy densities being the unknowns.

For both schemes we use a Crank-Nicolson approach to achieve second
order accurate time-integration. We expect second order convergence
rate.
