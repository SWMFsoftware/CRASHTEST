There are three tests
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Infinite medium: uniform material interacts with radiation
This test checks the material-radiation relaxation rate. 
Initially the material temperature is positive while the radiation 
temperature is zero. The final temperature is 1 keV. The initial
material temperature is determined from energy conservation. 

The temporal evolution is an exponential relaxation towards the
equilibrium temperature. We expect second order accuracy in time 
using the semi-implicit scheme with Crank-Nicolson scheme (there is
no hydro update). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Lightfront: propagation of a discontinuity in the radiation field.

The initial radiation field is zero. At the left boundary a constant
radiation energy is applied. The radiation should propagate inward 
with the speed of light. This is ensured by the flux-limiter in the
flux-limited gray diffusion algorithm. The expected convergence rate 
is less than 1 (but at least 0.5) due to the numerical diffusion of the
discontinuity.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Su-Olson test is a one-dimensional, non-equilibrium Marshak
wave test and is used to verify the correctness and accuracy of the
time-dependent gray radiation diffusion model. This test is a
linearized radiation transport problem in slab geometry. The
linearization is achieved by the choice of specific heat of material
proportional to the material temperature cubed. Initially both the
material and radiation temperature are zero. On the left boundary
the incoming radiation source is specified as a black body source
radiating with a radiation temperature of 1keV. The radiation
diffuses into the cold half space on the right. The material
temperature also rises due to the energy exchange between radiation
and matter.

The convergence study is performed with two different semi-implicit
schemes:

- radiation: solves for radiation energy density and it sets the the
             internal energy in a point implicit manner.
- radcond:   solves implicitly the gray diffusion with the radiation
             and internal energy densities being the unknowns.

For both schemes we use a Crank-Nicolson approach to achieve second
order accurate time-integration. We expect second order convergence
rate.
