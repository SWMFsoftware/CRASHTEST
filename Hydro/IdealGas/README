The Shu-Osher test is used to verify the correctness and 
accuracy of the hydro solvers. The test consists of a shock
passing through sinusoidal entropy waves (constant pressure,
varying density and temperature). The shock compresses the
waves and the resulting density peaks and troughs are quite
challenging to capture. We do the simulation on 1D and 2D 
uniform grids (with the shock front rotated by atan(1/2))
and 2D grid with non-uniform resolution.

The weekly test runs the last test only. Three different
solvers are tested: Rusanov (Lax-Friedrichs), Linde (HLLE),
and Godunov scheme. The results are compared to a very 
high resolution run. We expect first order convergence rate
due to the presence of the shock.
