These tests verify the hydro code for single-material ideal gas.

The sound wave problem has uniform density 1, pressure 0.6, and velocity 0.
The adiabatic index is 5/3, so the background sound speed is 1.
There is a smooth (cos^2) pressure and density perturbation of 10% amplitude
in the middle of the grid. The perturbation is isothermal, not adaiabatic,
so the solution has two sound waves going left and right plus an entropy 
at rest.

The solution is obtained with the Linde and Godunov fluxes using the MC3 
limiter with maximum beta parameter 2 (Koren's limiter). Both the 
conservative energy and non-conservative pressure equations are tested.
The grid resolution varies from 100, 200 to 400 cells.
The reference solution is calculated with 2000 grid points. 
We expect a second order convergence rate.

The Shu-Osher test is used to verify the correctness and 
accuracy of the hydro solvers. The test consists of a shock
passing through sinusoidal entropy waves (constant pressure,
varying density and temperature). The shock compresses the
waves and the resulting density peaks and troughs are quite
challenging to capture. We do the simulation on 1D and 2D 
uniform grids (with the shock front rotated by atan(1/2))
and 2D grid with non-uniform resolution.

The weekly test runs the last test only. Three different
solvers are tested: Rusanov (Lax-Friedrichs), Linde (HLLE),
and Godunov scheme. The results are compared to a very 
high resolution run. We expect first order convergence rate
due to the presence of the shock.
