These advection tests are testing the various schemes used 
for multi-material hydrodynamics. The initial condition has
constant pressure p = 1e11 Pa (high enough to ionize
the materials). The analytic solution is a simple advection 
of the material interfaces with the flow. 

In the 1D test there are two materials: Be and Xe. 
There is a density jump from 100 kg/m3 to 50 kg/m3,
the velocity is uniformly 100km/s.

In the 2D test there is an additional plastic tube
parallel with the Y axis, with density 1400 kg/m3 and
zero velocity so there is a huge shear flow at the boundary.

The test runs are named according to the method used:

- Godunov or Linde schemes

- 40, 80, 160, or 320 grid cells along the X axis

- LIMIT:   the levelset function/rho is limited 
           in the 2nd order TVD reconstruction

- MIXED:   the mixed cell approach is used

- LOOKUP:  the EOS is interpolated from lookup tables

- NONCONS: solve for the pressure instead of energy. Note that this is not
           fully implemented, but for this particular test the result is
           probably the same as it would be for the full implementation.
