The heat conduction tests are used to verify the correctness and
accuracy of the time-dependent heat conduction model. 

There are 3 tests:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Uniform tests: uniform heat conduction coefficient

- 1D diffusion of a Gaussian temperature profile. 

- 2D rz-geometry: combination of a Gaussian temperature profile 
  in the z-direction and a elevated J0 Bessel function in the r-direction.

For both tests we use a Crank-Nicolson approach to achieve second
order accurate time-integration. The results are compared with the
analytical solutions. We expect second order convergence rate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. RMTV: Reinicke and Meyer-ter Vehn test 

The Reinicke Meyer-ter Vehn test considers an initially strong and
concentrated explosion in an ambient gas for which Te = Ti.
The heat conduction dominates the fluid flow, leading to a
sizeable thermal front leading the shock front. This test uses a
non-linear heat conduction model.

The spherical blast wave is calculated in the rz-geometry and compared with the 
known self-similar solutions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Lowrie3: Lowrie's third radhydro test turned into a heat conduction test

In this test there is a discontinuity, and the heat conduction and the electron-ion
relaxation rate varies with temperature. 
The test is done on a 2D non-uniform grid. The initial condition is rotated
by atan$(1/2)$ and the solution is advected orthogonal to the shock front
(a constant velocity was added to the steady state solution). The
semi-analytic solution (provided by Lowrie) is advected together with the flow.
The errors are calculated relative to the semi-analytic solution with
various grid resolutions. 

We expect first order convergence.
