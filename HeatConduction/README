The heat conduction tests are used to verify the correctness and
accuracy of the time-dependent heat conduction model. There are two
tests, a one dimensional slab and a two dimensional rz-geometry
test, both assuming uniform heat conduction coefficient. The one
dimensional problem is the diffusion of a gaussian temperature
profile. The two dimensional test is a combination of a gaussian
temperature profile in the z-direction and a elevated J0 Bessel
function in the r-direction.
For both tests we use a Crank-Nicolson approach to achieve second
order accurate time-integration. The results are compared with the
analytical solutions. We expect second order convergence rate.
